These are Builtin functions of GCC compiler
​
__builtin_popcount(x): This function is used to count the number of one’s(set bits) in an integer.
​
__builtin_parity(x): This function is used to check the parity of a number. This function returns true(1) if the number has odd parity else it returns false(0) for even parity.
​
__builtin_clz(x): This function is used to count the leading zeros of the integer. Note: clz = count leading zero’s.
​
__builtin_ctz(x): This function is used to count the trailing zeros of the given integer. Note: ctz = count trailing zeros.
